# 💫 About Me:
🎓 I hold a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering** and a **Master’s in Cybersecurity**, strongly focusing on digital defense, ethical hacking, and threat detection. Over the past year, I’ve been deeply committed to advancing my technical skills through hands-on labs, independent study, and active participation in cybersecurity platforms.<br><br>🔐 My goal is to contribute to building secure digital systems by applying a blend of engineering principles, security methodologies, and a passion for continuous learning.<br><br>

# 🔭 Currently Working On
- 🧪 Building a custom **cybersecurity lab** to simulate attack and defense scenarios using Kali Linux, Metasploit, Security Onion, and Splunk.<br>
- 📈 Practicing threat analysis and detection using **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques and platforms like TryHackMe & Hack The Box.<br>
- 🗂️ Documenting workflows and lab results to develop a personal **InfoSec knowledge base** and showcase practical experience.<br><br>

# 🌱 Currently Learning
- 🛡️ **Threat Detection & SIEM Tools** (e.g., Wazuh, Splunk, OSSIM)<br>
- 🌐 **Web Application Security Testing** (OWASP Top 10, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP)<br>
- 🧠 **Digital Forensics** (Autopsy, Volatility, FTK Imager)<br>
- 🐍 **Python for Security Automation** (log parsing, alert scripts, reporting)<br>
- 📚 Preparing for **CompTIA Security+**, with plans for **CEH** and **GCFA**<br><br><br>

#  👯 Open to Collaborating On
- 🧩 Open-source cybersecurity tools or beginner-friendly security projects<br>
- 🎯 Capture The Flag (CTF) teams and security challenge events<br>
- 📰 Educational content or guides on cybersecurity fundamentals<br>
- 🔍 Malware analysis labs or small-scale forensic case simulations<br><br>

# 🤝 Looking For
- 🧑‍💻 **Entry-level cybersecurity roles**, such as:<br>
  - SOC Analyst  <br>
  - Junior Penetration Tester  <br>  
  - Cybersecurity Analyst  <br>
  - Digital Forensics Assistant<br>
- 🧭 Mentorship and career guidance from InfoSec professionals<br>
- 🛠️ Real-world exposure to incident response, vulnerability management, and network monitoring environments<br><br>

#  💬 Ask Me About
- 🧰 Setting up a personal cybersecurity lab using free tools and virtual machines<br>
- 🧾 Basic digital forensic workflows — from disk imaging to artifact recovery<br>
- 🔁 Transitioning into cybersecurity from a general tech/engineering background<br>
- 📚 Learning resources and study paths I found helpful in my journey<br><br>

# ⚡ Fun Fact
I love analyzing real-world cyberattack case studies and recreating them in lab environments to understand how they unfolded — and how they could’ve been stopped. It’s both a challenge and a form of training.
